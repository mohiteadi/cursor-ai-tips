# Cursor vs Windsurf: Complete Comparison (2025)

[← Back to Main](../README.md)

## Overview

Both Cursor and Windsurf are VS Code forks with deep AI integration. Here's how they compare in late 2025.

## Philosophy Comparison

| Aspect | Cursor | Windsurf |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Philosophy** | Augmentation | Augmentation |
| **Control Level** | User is pilot | More autonomous |
| **Architecture** | VS Code Fork (Native) | VS Code Fork (Native) |
| **Target User** | Power users, enterprises | Beginners, rapid prototyping |

---

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Cursor (Composer/Agent) | Windsurf (Cascade) | Verdict |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Context Awareness** | Manual/Granular with @symbols | Deep Auto-Indexing | Windsurf is more approachable |
| **Code Editing** | Composer (Cmd+I) with Normal/Agent modes | Flow agent | Cursor wins on Tab prediction |
| **Pricing** | $20/month (500 fast requests) | $15/month (often unlimited) | Windsurf is cheaper |
| **Model Access** | All models (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini, BYOK) | Primarily Claude + proprietary | Cursor wins for model arbitrage |
| **Refactoring** | Agent Mode (can be slow) | "Vibe and Replace" | Windsurf has edge for large refactors |
| **Multi-File** | Composer ⭐ | Cascade | Both excellent |
| **Special Features** | Plan Mode, Instant Grep | Auto-context, Initiative | Different strengths |

## The "Initiative" Gap

A critical differentiator is how proactive each AI is.

### Windsurf Cascade

```
More Proactive:
- Runs shell commands without asking
- Installs dependencies automatically
- Makes decisions independently
- Feels "magical" to new users
```

### Cursor Agent

```
More Cautious:
- Asks permission for shell commands
- Requires explicit approval for destructive actions
- Developer reviews before execution
- Safer for enterprise environments
```

**Choose based on your comfort level**:
- New developers → Windsurf's initiative feels helpful
- Senior engineers → Cursor's control prevents surprises

---

## Context Management

### Cursor Approach

```
Manual but precise:
@Files - Explicit file reference
@Codebase - Semantic search
@Folders - Directory context
.mdc rules - Glob-based injection
```

**Pros**: Full control over what AI sees
**Cons**: Requires learning @ syntax

### Windsurf Approach

```
Automatic indexing:
- Codebase indexed on open
- Agent decides relevance
- Less typing required
```

**Pros**: Beginner-friendly, less friction
**Cons**: Less control, may read too much

## Model Ecosystem

### Cursor (Winner)

```
Native Support:
├── Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet
├── GPT-5.1 High Max
├── Gemini 3 Pro
├── Grok 4.1
└── BYOK (OpenRouter, custom APIs)

Model Arbitrage:
- Use cheap models for simple tasks
- Reserve expensive models for complex work
- Switch models based on task type
```

### Windsurf

```
Limited Options:
├── Claude 3.5 Sonnet (primary)
├── SWE-1.5 (proprietary)
└── Less flexibility

Locked Ecosystem:
- Cannot easily add new models
- Less cost optimization options
```

---

## Pricing Breakdown

### Cursor Pro ($20/month)

```
Includes:
├── 500 fast requests/month
├── Unlimited slow requests
├── All native models
├── Agent Mode
└── Checkpoints
```

### Windsurf Pro ($15/month)

```
Includes:
├── Often unlimited Flow actions
├── Deep indexing
├── Cascade agent
└── Auto-context
```

### Verdict

- **Budget conscious**: Windsurf
- **Power users**: Cursor (with BYOK for heavy usage)
- **Enterprise**: Cursor (model flexibility, control)

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Cursor When

```
✅ Working with existing large codebases
✅ Need model flexibility (arbitrage)
✅ Want explicit control over AI actions
✅ Enterprise environment with compliance needs
✅ Using Plan Mode for complex tasks
✅ Need checkpoint/rollback features
```

### Choose Windsurf When

```
✅ Starting new projects from scratch
✅ Prefer automatic context management
✅ Want lower monthly cost
✅ New to AI-assisted coding
✅ Large-scale autonomous refactoring
✅ Prefer "just works" experience
```

---

## Migration Considerations

### Cursor → Windsurf

```
What transfers:
✅ VS Code settings/extensions
✅ Git configuration
✅ Project files

What doesn't:
❌ .cursorrules / .mdc files
❌ Cursor-specific shortcuts
❌ Notepads/saved context
```

### Windsurf → Cursor

```
What transfers:
✅ VS Code settings/extensions
✅ Project files

What you'll need:
• Learn @ symbol syntax
• Create .mdc rules
• Configure BYOK if needed
```
