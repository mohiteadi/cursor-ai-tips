## Cursor vs Google Antigravity

### Philosophy Difference

| Aspect | Cursor | Antigravity |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Role** | Developer is pilot | Developer is mission controller |
| **Control** | Verify every edit | Trust agent output |
| **Verification** | Git diffs, code review | Artifacts (screenshots, logs) |
| **Best For** | Precision, existing codebases | Greenfield, rapid prototyping |
| **Lock-in** | Model agnostic | Google ecosystem |

### Antigravity's Advantages

1. **Parallel Agents**: Run multiple agents simultaneously on different tasks
2. **Native Responsiveness Testing**: Auto-resize viewport testing built-in
3. **Artifacts System**: Visual verification beyond diffs
4. **Free Preview**: No cost barrier to entry

### Cursor's Advantages

1. **Model Choice**: Use Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any model
2. **Precision Control**: Review every change before applying
3. **Mature Ecosystem**: Established .cursorrules, MCP integrations
4. **VS Code Compatibility**: Familiar environment

### The "Free Preview" Threat

Users are adopting a hybrid workflow:
```
1. Use Cursor until paid credits exhausted
2. Switch to Antigravity for free
3. Continue working without interruption
4. Return to Cursor when credits refresh
```

This commoditizes the "AI IDE" layer — developers are loyal to capability, not brand.

## Cursor vs Windsurf

### The "Initiative Gap"

The critical differentiator:

| Aspect | Cursor | Windsurf |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Autonomy** | Asks permission by default | Acts proactively |
| **Shell Commands** | Requires approval | Often auto-executes |
| **User Feeling** | Controlled, predictable | "Magical" but scary |

### User Sentiment

> "Windsurf feels magical to new users, but terrifying to senior engineers who want to review every shell command."

### When to Choose Which

**Choose Cursor if:**
- Working on production code
- Need precise control over changes
- Want to review shell commands
- Prefer explicit over implicit

**Choose Windsurf if:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Trust auto-context decisions
- Want "magical" experience
- Less concerned about review

## Cursor vs GitHub Copilot

### Architecture Difference

| Aspect | Cursor | Copilot |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Type** | Fork of VS Code | Extension |
| **Integration** | Native, deep | Surface-level |
| **Multi-file** | Composer (full) | Limited |
| **Model** | Any | OpenAI only |

### Cursor Advantages

- **Composer**: True multi-file editing agent
- **Model Choice**: Switch between Claude, GPT, Gemini
- **Plan Mode**: Strategic thinking before coding
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to databases, browsers, APIs

### Copilot Advantages

- **Enterprise SSO**: Better for large organizations
- **Price**: $10/mo vs $20/mo
- **Stability**: More conservative, fewer bugs
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless with GitHub ecosystem

## The Verdict (December 2025)

| Use Case | Recommended Tool |
|----------|------------------|
| **Production code, precision** | Cursor |
| **Full automation experiments** | Google Antigravity |
| **Auto-context, rapid prototyping** | Windsurf |
| **Enterprise compliance** | GitHub Copilot |
| **Budget-conscious** | Antigravity (free) or Copilot ($10) |
| **Model flexibility** | Cursor |

---

## Future Outlook

### What Cursor Must Do to Compete

1. **Native parallel agents** — match Antigravity's multi-agent capability
2. **Artifacts system** — visual verification beyond diffs
3. **Simplified MCP** — one-click setup for browser automation
4. **Free tier** — or more generous trial to compete
5. **Stability fixes** — the "Plan" disconnect bug erodes trust

### The Convergence Trend

All tools are moving toward:
- More autonomous agents
- Better verification systems
- Multi-model support
- Visual debugging tools

The winner will be whoever achieves **autonomy without sacrificing trust**.
