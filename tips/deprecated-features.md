# Deprecated Features in Cursor 2.0/2.1

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This guide documents features removed or changed in Cursor 2.0+.

---

## Overview

Cursor 2.0/2.1 shifted from manual context management to **autonomous agent-based workflows**, deprecating several power-user features.

---

## 1. Interpreter Mode (Removed)

### What It Was
Isolated Python sandbox (like OpenAI Code Interpreter) for data analysis and visualization.

### Current Alternative
Agent + Terminal execution. No built-in visualization UI.

### Migration
Use Jupyter notebooks alongside Cursor for data visualization workflows.

---

## 2. Explicit Context Symbols (Deprecated)

### Removed Symbols
| Symbol | Was | Now |
|--------|-----|-----|
| `@Definitions` | Manual type lookup | Auto-resolved |
| `@Web` | Force web search | Agent searches automatically |
| `@Link` | Add URL content | Agent fetches automatically |
| `@Recent Changes` | Git diff context | Use `@Git` explicitly |
| `@Linter Errors` | Lint diagnostics | Shadow Workspace handles |

### Still Working
- `@Files` - Explicit file reference
- `@Folders` - Directory context  
- `@Codebase` - Semantic search
- `@Docs` - External documentation
- `@Git` - Git history

---

## 3. Reapply Button (Removed)

### What It Was
Quick retry when Agent code failed.

### Current Alternative
- Use Checkpoints to restore previous state
- Start new Composer (Cmd+N) for fresh attempt
- Review & Reject flow (Cmd+Y / Cmd+N)

---

## 4. Legacy .cursorrules (Deprecated)

### Old Way
Single `.cursorrules` file in project root.

### New Way
Modular `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── global.mdc           # alwaysApply: true
├── react-standards.mdc  # globs: ["**/*.tsx"]
└── python-backend.mdc   # globs: ["**/*.py"]
```

[→ See mdc-examples.md for templates](mdc-examples.md)

---

## 5. Fast Request Packs (Removed)

### Old Model
Buy 500 fast request credits.

### New Model
- Usage-based pricing
- Pro plan: 500 fast/month included
- Enterprise: custom limits
- BYOK for heavy users

---

## Quick Reference

| Feature | Status | Replacement |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Interpreter Mode | ❌ | Agent + Terminal |
| @Web, @Definitions | ❌ | Auto-context |
| Reapply Button | ❌ | Checkpoints |
| .cursorrules | ⚠️ Legacy | .mdc files |
| Fast Request Packs | ❌ | Usage-based |

---

## Coping Strategies

1. **Trust Auto-Context** - AI gathers what it needs
2. **Use Checkpoints** - Built-in undo system
3. **Migrate to .mdc** - Better than monolithic rules
4. **Fresh Chats Often** - Avoid context pollution
5. **Commit Before Agent** - Always have git backup
